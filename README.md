# YOLOv5-YOLOv6-YOLOv7-YOLOv8-Object-Detection-Models-For-Personal-Protective-Equipment-Detection
This repository implements the cutting-edge YOLO Object Detection Models until April 2023 (YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8) for detecting Personal Protective Equipments (Masks and Helmets) for safety enhancement.

## Image Datasets
We used 2 public / free datasets from https://roboflow.com/. One is the Mask Wearing Image Dataset (https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/mask-wearing), and the other one is the Helmets / Hard-Hats Wearing Image Dataset (https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/hard-hat-workers). Please download the 2 datasets from the RoboFlow website, unzip them, and place them accordingly under the "datasets" folder, as shown below:

## Model Structure
Please run the setup notebook first, before you start training and testing any YOLO models.
